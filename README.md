# Verilog Projects Repository

This repository contains a collection of Verilog projects developed as part of my coursework and personal exploration of digital design. Each project demonstrates key concepts in hardware design, including controllers, communication protocols, memory management, and arithmetic operations.

## Projects Overview

### 1. Double Dabble
A Verilog implementation of the Double Dabble algorithm, used to convert binary values to Binary-Coded Decimal (BCD) format.

### 2. FIFO Buffer
A first-in, first-out (FIFO) buffer implementation for temporary data storage, demonstrating efficient data management in hardware designs.

### 3. SPI Communication
An SPI (Serial Peripheral Interface) communication module that facilitates data exchange between devices, such as microcontrollers and sensors, using a synchronous communication protocol.

### 4. SRAM Verilog
An implementation of a static RAM (SRAM) controller, allowing efficient read/write operations to and from external memory.

### 5. UART
Full implementation of UART communication, including both transmission and reception of data, providing a foundation for serial communication in digital systems.

### 6. Unsigned Division
Implementation of an efficient unsigned division algorithm in Verilog, demonstrating arithmetic computation without built-in hardware division.
