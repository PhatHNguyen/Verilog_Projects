Verilog Projects Repository

This repository contains a collection of my personal Verilog projects. Each project demonstrates a key concept in hardware design, including finite state machines (FSM), controllers, arithmetic units, and more. Below is an overview of the projects available:

Projects Overview


UART Transmitter and Receiver:
Full implementation of UART communication, including both transmission and reception of data, providing a foundation for serial communication in digital systems.
SRAM: 
Implementation of a static RAM (SRAM) controller, allowing efficient read/write operations from external memory.
FIFO Buffer:
A first-in, first-out (FIFO) buffer implementation for temporary data storage, demonstrating efficient data management in hardware designs.
Unsigned Division Module:
Implementation of an efficient unsigned division algorithm in Verilog, demonstrating arithmetic computation without built-in hardware division.
